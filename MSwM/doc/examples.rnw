\begin{abstract}
  Two examples are described to illustrate the use of the \texttt{MSwM} package. First, a simulated dataset is modeled in detail.
  Next, Markov Switching Models are fitted to a real dataset with a discrete response variable. The main methods and graphical representations are used to validate different approaches to model these
  datasets.

\section{Simulated Example}
The \texttt{example} data is a simulated data set to show how \texttt{msmFit} can detect the presence of two different regimes: one in which the response variable is highly correlated 
and other in which the response only depends on an exogenous variable \texttt{x}. The autocorrelated observations are in the intervals 1 to 100, 151 to 180 and 251 to 300. The real models for each regime are:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
    y_{t}=\left\{
      \begin{array}{lll}
        8+2x_{t}+\varepsilon^{(1)}_{t} & \epsilon^{(1)}_{t}\sim{N(0,1)} & t =101:150,181:250 \\
        1+0.9y_{t-1}+\varepsilon^{(2)}_{t} & \epsilon^{(2)}_{t}\sim{N(0,0.5)} & t =1:100,151:180,251:300 
      \end{array}
    \right.
\end{array}
\]

\caption{Simulated data. The \texttt{y} variable is the response variable and there are two periods in which this depends on the \texttt{x} covariate}
\label{fig1.1}
\end{figure}
The plot in Fig.\ref{fig1.1} shows that in the intervals where does not exist autocorrelation the response variable \texttt{y} has a similar behaviour as the covariant \texttt{x}.
A linear model is fitted to study how the covariate \texttt{x} explains the variable response \texttt{y}.
<<echo=TRUE>>=
mod=lm(y~x,example)
summary(mod)
@ 
The covariate is really significant but the data behaviour is very bad explained by the model. 
The plot of the linear model residuals in Fig.\ref{fig1.1} indicates that their autocorrelation is significant.

  \label{fig1_3_4}
\end{figure}
The diagnostics plots for the residuals (Fig.\ref{fig1_3_4}) confirm that they does not seem to be white noise and that they have autocorrelation.
Next, a Autoregressive Markov Switching Model (MSM-AR) is fitted to the data. The order for the autoregressive part is set to one. In order to indicate that all the parameters can be different in both periods, 
the switching parameter (\texttt{sw}) is set to a vector with four components with value equal to TRUE. The last value when fitting a linear model is referred to the residual standard deviation.
There are some options to control the estimation process, like a logical parameter to indicate whether parallelization of the process is done or not.

summary(mod.mswm)
@
The model \texttt{mod.mswm} has a regime where the covariant \texttt{x} is very significant and in the other regime the autocorrelation variable 
is very significant too. In both, the R-squared have high values. Finally, the transition probabilities matrix has high values 
which indicate that is difficult to change from on regime to the other.

The residuals look like to be white noise and they fit to the Normal Distribution. Moreover, the autocorrelation has disappeared.

\section{Daily Traffic Casualties by car accidents in Spain}

The \texttt{traffic} data (Fig.\ref{fig2.1}) contains the daily number of deaths in traffic accidents in Spain during the year 2010, the average daily temperature and
the daily sum of precipitations. The interest of this data is to study the relation between the number of deaths with the climate conditions.
We illustrate the use of a Generalized Markov Switching Model in this case because there exists a different behaviour between the variables during weekends and working days.
To avoid a long example, the explanations of how the functions work and repeated results are skipped.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
<<echo=false,fig=TRUE>>=
data(traffic)
plot(ts(traffic[2:4]),main="Traffic")
@
  \caption{Traffic data: Daily traffic casualties in Spain and climate variables}
  \label{fig2.1}
\end{figure}

In this example, the response variable is a counting variable. For this reason we fit a Poisson Generalized Linear Model.
<<echo=TRUE>>=
model=glm(NDead~Temp+Prec,traffic,family="poisson")
summary(model)
@
In the next step, the Markov Switching Model is fitted using \texttt{msmFit}. To fit a Generalized Markov Switching Model, the family parameter has to be included.
Moreover, the glm's don't have the standard deviation parameter and, because of this, the \texttt{sw} parameter doesn't contain its switching parameter.

<<echo=TRUE>>=
m1=msmFit(model,k=2,sw=c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE),family="poisson",control=list(parallel=FALSE))
summary(m1)
@
Both states have significant covariates, but the precipitation covariate is only significant in one of the two.

\caption{Residuals form the Autoregressive MSM model}
\label{fig3.2}
\end{figure}
The Pearson residuals from Fig. \ref{fig3.2} are calculated from an object of class 'MSM.glm' because the model is an extension of a General Linear Model. 
The residuals have the classical structure of white noise.

  \caption{Normal Probability plot and Autocorrelation Function of the residuals from the Autoregressive MSwM model. They are obtained by using the \texttt{plotDiag} method}
  \label{fig2_3_4}
\end{figure}
The residuals aren't autocorrelated but they don't fit very well to a Normal Distribution. However, normality of the Pearson residuals is not a critical condition for generalized linear model validation.

\end{figure}
Using the function \texttt{plotProb} we can see how the regimes are distributed in shorts periods because the bigger one contains basically working days.
