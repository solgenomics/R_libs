Title: 'date' C++ Header Library for Date and Time Functionality
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2020-03-17
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: 'date' is a C++ header library offering extensive date
 and time functionality for the C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards
 written by Howard Hinnant and released under the MIT license. A
 slightly modified version has been accepted (along with 'tz.h') as
 part of C++20. This package regroups all header files from the
 upstream repository by Howard Hinnant so that other R packages can
 use them in their C++ code. At present, few of the types have
 explicit 'Rcpp' wrapper though these may be added as needed.
