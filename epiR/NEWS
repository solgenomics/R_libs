CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 2.0.16

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o epi.2by2 code modified to allow it handle the Haldane-Anscombe correction (i.e. addition of 0.5 to each cell of the 2 by 2 table when at least one of the cell frequencies is zero).

    [Spotted by Sarah Haile]
    o Vignette for surveillance functions updated.
    o epi.2by2 calculates maximum likelihood confidence intervals for the odds ratio when the total number of events is less than 2E09, removing numeric overflow errors. 
    [Suggested by Stuart Reece]
    o New function epi.psi: Proportional similarity index to compare non-parametric frequency distributions.
    o epi.prcc now includes confidence intervals. Example provided in the documentation for epi.prcc improved.

    [Suggested by Alex Hou] 

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-15

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Function epi.insthaz now handles stratified data. Examples in function documentation updated to reflect these changes.
    o Argument rho in function epi.sscc changed to rho.cc to avoid confusion with rho used to represent the intracluster correlation coefficient.
    [Suggested by Xiaoqing Liu] 
    o Amibguity in documentation for epi.sscomps corrected.
    [Spotted by Marco Barbara]
    o Function epi.2by2 now includes Taylor series confidence intervals for the incidence risk and prevalence ratio.

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-14

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Long overdue vignette included. 

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-13

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o epi.2by2 calculates Cornfield confidence intervals for the odds ratio when the total number of events is less than 500. This reduces computation time when cell frequencies are large.
    [Suggested by Jeff Canar]
    o epi.ssdetect now uses the hypergeometric distribution to calculate sample size, removing the need to apply a finite correction factor.
    [Suggested by Manuel Sanchez Vazquez]
    o epi.ssninfb
    Inconsistency in function documentation.
    [Spotted by Winston Mason]
    Fixed. 

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-12

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o New function epi.smr: Computes confidence intervals and tests of significance of the standardised mortality [morbidity] ratio.

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-11

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o epi.2by2
    Inconsistency in variables returned from print(epi.2by2) and summary(epi.2by2) corrected.
    [Spotted by Jose G Conde Santiago]

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-10

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o epi.interaction
    Function now includes option to use either product or dummy parameterisation of interaction terms. Documentation updated.
    [Suggested by Francois M Carrier]
    o New function epi.sscohortc: Sample size, power or minimum detectable incidence risk ratio for a cohort study using individual count data.
    o New function epi.sscohortt: Sample size, power or minimum detectable incidence rate ratio for a cohort study using individual time data.    
    o New function epi.ssxsectn: Sample size, power or minimum detectable preva;ence ratio for a cross-sectional study.

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-06

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Functions to calculate sample size. Major revision of the naming of functions to calculate sample size.
    o New function epi.ssclus1estb: Sample size to estimate a binary outcome using one-stage cluster sampling.

    [Spotted by Maia Dolgopoloff]
    Fixed.

BUG FIXES
