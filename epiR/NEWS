CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-15

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Function epi.insthaz now handles stratified data. Examples in function documentation updated to reflect these changes.
    o Argument rho in function epi.sscc changed to rho.cc to avoid confusion with rho used to represent the intracluster correlation coefficient.
    [Suggested by Xiaoqing Liu] 
    o Amibguity in documentation for epi.sscomps corrected.
    [Spotted by Marco Barbara]
    o Function epi.2by2 now included Taylor series confidence intervals for the incidence risk and prevalence ratio.

    o Long overdue vignette included. 

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-13

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o epi.2by2 calculates Cornfield confidence intervals for the odds ratio when the total number of events is less than 500. This reduces computation time when cell frequencies are large.
    [Suggested by Jeff Canar]
    o epi.ssdetect now uses the hypergeometric distribution to calculate sample size, removing the need to apply a finite correction factor.
    [Suggested by Manuel Sanchez Vazquez]
    o epi.ssninfb
    Inconsistency in function documentation.
    [Spotted by Winston Mason]
    Fixed. 

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-12

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o New function epi.smr: Computes confidence intervals and tests of significance of the standardised mortality [morbidity] ratio.

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-11

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o epi.2by2
    Inconsistency in variables returned from print(epi.2by2) and summary(epi.2by2) corrected.
    [Spotted by Jose G Conde Santiago]

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-10

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o epi.interaction
    Function now includes option to use either product or dummy parameterisation of interaction terms. Documentation updated.
    [Suggested by Francois M Carrier]
    o New function epi.sscohortc: Sample size, power or minimum detectable incidence risk ratio for a cohort study using individual count data.
    o New function epi.sscohortt: Sample size, power or minimum detectable incidence rate ratio for a cohort study using individual time data.    
    o New function epi.ssxsectn: Sample size, power or minimum detectable preva;ence ratio for a cross-sectional study.

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-06

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Functions to calculate sample size. Major revision of the naming of functions to calculate sample size.
    o New function epi.ssclus1estb: Sample size to estimate a binary outcome using one-stage cluster sampling.

CHANGES IN epiR VERSION 1.0-04

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o epi.conf
    Error in incidence rate confidence interval calculation.
    [Spotted by Kazuki Yoshida]
    Fixed.
    
    o epi.detectsize
    Inconsistency in function documentation.
    [Spotted by Jamie Madden]
    Fixed. 
    
    o epi.kappa
    Function returns an error if the number of rows and number of columns in the data table presented for analysis does not equal two.
    [Spotted by Maia Dolgopoloff]
    Fixed.

BUG FIXES

    o epi.2by
    Anomalies in calculation of test of homogeneity in strata odds ratios and risk ratios corrected. Argument "homogeneity" removed from function. Woolf test of homogeneity reported by default for print(x, ...). Test statistics, degrees of freedom and p-values for Breslow Day and Woolf tests of homogeneity returned using summary(x, ...). 
    [Spotted by Antonio A Lopes]
    Fixed.
