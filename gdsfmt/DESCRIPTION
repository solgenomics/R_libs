Description: Provides a high-level R interface to CoreArray Genomic Data
        Structure (GDS) data files. GDS is portable across platforms with
        hierarchical structure to store multiple scalable array-oriented data
        sets with metadata information. It is suited for large-scale datasets,
        especially for data which are much larger than the available
        random-access memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient operations
        specifically designed for integers of less than 8 bits, since a diploid
        genotype, like single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), usually occupies
        fewer bits than a byte. Data compression and decompression are available
        with relatively efficient random access. It is also allowed to read a
        GDS file in parallel with multiple R processes supported by the package
        parallel.
