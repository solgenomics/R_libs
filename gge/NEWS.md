## Todo

New argument `focus` for Different Singular Value Partitionings, including GH, JK, SQRT, HJ.

New function `ggbiplot()` function using `ggplot2` graphics to draw the biplot.

Average Environment Coordinate

Bootstrap testing for PCs (Forkman 2019 paper)

Bootstrap conf int

# gge 1.5 (20 Jul 2020)

* Please use `gge(data,formula)` instead of `gge(formula,data)`.

* New argument `ggb=TRUE` to request construction of GGB biplot.

# gge 1.4 (15 May 2018)

* Use `cex.gen=0` to omit genotype names.

* On some Windows machines, `library(rgl)` crashes R, perhaps because of a DLL conflict with Windows. Removed `@import rgl` so that `rgl` is not loaded by default, and now `biplot3d` uses calls like `rgl::text3d`.

# gge 1.3 (14 Dec 2017)

* The `nipals()` function using C++ code has been removed.

* The `rnipals()` function has been removed.

* The `gge` package now imports the `nipals` package, which is new.

# gge 1.2 (25 May 2017)

* New function `nipals()` for finding principal components using C++.  Code from `pcaMethods` package.

* New function `rnipals()` for finding principal components in R.

* New function `biplot3d()` to draw 3d biplots using `rgl` package.

* Modifed `main`, `subtitle`, `xlab`, `ylab` arguments to allow removal.

* Changed `title` argument to `main` for consistency with other packages.

* Now using `testthat` and `covr` packages.

* Added package logo on github.

# gge 1.1 (8 Oct 2016)

* Added `zoom.gen` and `zoom.env` arguments to `biplot()` for  M.Zoric.

* Moved tests to `tests/gge_tests.R`

# gge 1.0 (14 Dec 2015)

* Package `gge` is split off from `agridat` package.

* Added `origin`, `hull` arguments to `biplot()`.

# gge 0.1 (2013)

* Added `gge()` to agridat package.

# gge 0.0 (May 2004)

* Created function `gge()` to fit and plot GGE biplots.

## A history of NIPALS functions

1. (2007) Created `nipals()` based on `pcaMethods::nipalsPca()`.  Modified the function for faster execution and submitted a patch back to `pcaMethods`.

2. (2010) Henning Redestig created a C++ version of NIPALS for the `pcaMethods` package.

3. (2017) The `gge::nipals()` R function is re-named `rnipals()`, and a new `nipals()` function is created, based on the C++ code in `pcaMethods`. Released gge version 1.2.

4. (2017) Discovered that `mixOmics::nipals()` is a pure R function that is faster than the C++ version, so `gge::nipals()` was re-written into a pure R function. The C++ version was removed from the `gge` package. 

5. The `gge::nipals` function is moved to a new package, `nipals::nipals`. The function is optimized for performance, improved to better handle missing values and to orthogonalize the principal components.
