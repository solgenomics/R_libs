Changes since version 0.6.0:
----------------------------
* Fixed internal bug when extracting formals from fitters.
* Updated contact details.
* Fixed missing link from documentation.

Changes since version 0.5.8:
----------------------------
* Avoid warnings due to vector matrix multiplication + minor edits.
* Updated contact details

Changes since version 0.5.7:
----------------------------
* Updated contact and citation information. 

Changes since version 0.5-6:
----------------------------
* changed the default number of grid points to 20.

Changes since version 0.5-5:
----------------------------
* Minor bug corrections and minor corrections in the help files.
* The print method for profileModel objects, now print a reports on asymptotes when appropriate.
* Added citation file.

Changes since version 0.5-4:
----------------------------
* Corrected a bug, that could cause error messages in the preliminary iteration when an aliased out parameter was present in the fit (thanks to Michael Dewey).

Changes since version 0.5-3:
----------------------------
* Corrected a bug in the signedSquareRoots method, that could cause computation of signed square roots with wrong sign when asymptotes where detected.

Changes since version 0.5-2:
----------------------------
*	Corrected a bug in the profZoom method that was related to the profile values that where used for the binary search. The evaluation of the profiles at candidate endpoints was not always accurate due to poor starting values within 'profiling'.  Now is stable but slightly extra computational effort is needed than in the previous version.
*	Minor improvements of the help files.
*	Corrected a bug that was affecting the output of the parameter names in the profZoom method. 


Changes since version 0.5-1:
----------------------------
*	The function scaleFit() was re-written in order to support more model classes.
*	A change in the position of the comments in plot.profileModel.R after recommendation from B. Venables.
*	Correction of typos (sorry!) and various improvements of the help files.
