Description: Diverse spatial datasets for demonstrating, benchmarking and teaching spatial data analysis. 
    It includes R data of class sf (defined by the package 'sf'), Spatial ('sp'), and nb ('spdep').
    Unlike other spatial data packages such as 'rnaturalearth' and 'maps', 
    it also contains data stored in a range of file formats including GeoJSON, ESRI Shapefile and GeoPackage. 
    Some of the datasets are designed to illustrate specific analysis techniques.
    cycle_hire() and cycle_hire_osm(), for example, is designed to illustrate point pattern analysis techniques.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
