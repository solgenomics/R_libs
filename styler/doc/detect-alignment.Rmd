```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

Sometimes, you deliberately align code to make it more readable.

```{r}
call(
  a =       3,
  b = 3213232
)

```

Until styler 1.1.1.9002 (with `strict = TRUE`, e.g. as in
`styler::style_file(..., strict = TRUE)`), this was formatted as follows:

```{r}
call(
  a = 3,
  b = 3213232
)

```

because no alignment detection was built in.^[With `strict = FALSE`, the spacing
would have been kept, however, `strict = FALSE` has a number of other
implications because it is in general less invasive. For example, it would not
add braces and line breaks to "if (TRUE) return()".]

styler >= 1.1.1.9003 detects aforementioned alignment for function calls. This
vignette describes how aligned code is defined in styler and gives some examples
so users can format their aligned code to match the definition styler uses to
ensure their code is not unintentionally reformatted.

An important definition used in the remainder is the one of a **column**. All
arguments of a function call that have the same position but are placed on
different lines form a column. The below call shows a call with two columns and
two rows. Columns separate arguments of the function call, so the separator is
the comma. The first row is named because all arguments are named, the second is
unnamed:

```{r}
call(
  # column 1  | column 2 |
  abkj = f(2),         7,
  more_ = "a", 2 # more
)
```

## Function calls

### Non-technical definition

Below, we try to explain in an intuitive way how your code should look like to
be recognized as aligned.

**If all arguments in the first column are named**: Make commas match position
vertically and right align everything between commas:

```{r}
# all arguments of first column named -> must right align
# aligned if the (imaginary) comma on the last line is in line with the commas 
# from the two top lines.
fell(
  x  =    1, 
  y  =   23,
  zz = NULL
)

# this works also with more than one column
fell(
  x  =    1, annoying = 3, 
  y  =   23, # nothing in column 2 for row 2
  zz = NULL, finally = ""
)
```

**If not all arguments of the first column are named:**^[In the below example,
the first argument of the first column is named (`p = 2`). The second argument
of the first column is not (`31`).] Make **all except the first column's
commas** match position

- vertically

- right align everything between the commas

- except before the first comma on a line

- give priority to correctly indent (i.e. left align):

```{r}
# not all arguments of first column named, hence, only 
# commas of all but the first column must agree.
gell(
  p = 2,   g = gg(x),  n = 3 * 3, #
  31,    fds =    -1, gz = f / 3,
)

```

By *align everything in between the commas*, we mean put zero space before a
comma and at least one after. Note that the arguments on the first line are
ignored when detecting alignment, which is best shown when code is formatted
such that no line breaks will be modified by _styler_. This applies if all names
on the first line are unnamed and all subsequent are named:

```{r}
map(x, f, 
 arg1 =  121,
 arg2 =    1
)
```

**Examples**

These typical examples match _styler_'s definition of alignment.

```{r}
tibble::tribble(
  ~key_here,  ~value_here,
  "left",         "right", # comments are allowed
  "long string",   "shrt" # columns can overlap ('~' above ',')
)

purrr::map(x, fun, # arguments on same line as opening brace are not considered
  arg2  =    2, 
  ar    = f(x)
)
```

### Technical definition

This section closely follows the implementation of the alignment detection and
is mostly aimed at developers for understanding _styler_ internals.

Function calls are aligned if **all** of the following conditions hold (for all
but the very first line (i.e. `call(` below):

* all rows in first column have the same number of lag spaces. This basically
  means that the indention is identical for all columns (except for the closing
  brace if it is on its own line). The below example has one column, because the
  maximal number of commas on one line is one.

```{r}
# holds
call(
  a =  3,
  b = 32
)

# doesn't hold
call(
  a =  3,
   b = 32
)
```

* spacing around comma (0 before, > 1 after, >= 0 after last column on line) and
  spacing around `=` (at least one before and after).

```{r}
# holds
call(
  a =  3, k  = 3,
  b = 32,    222
)

# doesn't hold
call(
  a =  3 ,
  b = 32
)
```

* All commas from all columns are aligned. This means that for every column, all
  commas must be on the same positions as the commas from the other lines. If
  not all arguments are named in the first column, this column is not
  considered. The reason to exclude the first column is that, as in the example
  below, it is possible that some arguments are named while others are not.
  Then, it is not generally possible to keep the first rule (i.e. indention
  identical across lines). Also ensuring that the comma does not have any spaces
  before it and its alignment with other lines does not hold true. This is shown
  below with the line `f(x, y),`. For this reason, the requirements exclude the
  first column in such cases. The *holds* example shows that is is possible (but
  not required) for named arguments to also have the commas separating the first
  and second column aligned.

```{r}
# holds
call(
  a =  ff("pk"), k  = 3, x =  2,
  b =     f(-g), 22 + 1, yy = 1,
  c =         1,
  f(x, y), 
  k
)

# doesn't hold
call(
  a =   3,
  b = 32, c = 2
)
```

Note that the above definition does not check alignment of `=`, so _styler_ will
treat the following as aligned:

```{r}
rge(
  x  = 99, x =  2,
  fs =  1,  y = 1,
)
```
