Description: Originally designed application in the context of resource-limited plant research and breeding programs, waves provides an open-source solution to spectral data processing and model development by bringing useful packages together into a streamlined pipeline. This package is wrapper for functions related to the analysis of point visible and near-infrared reflectance measurements. It includes visualization, filtering, aggregation, preprocessing, cross-validation set formation, model training, and prediction functions to enable open-source association of spectral and reference data.
